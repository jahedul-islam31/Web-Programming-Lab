    <h1>Local Hosting|| ID:E251031</h1>
    <p>Local hosting means running a website or web application on your
         own computer instead of a live server on the internet.
         Basically, your PC acts like the server, and you can open the site 
         only on your device (sometimes also in the same network)</p><hr>
    
    
         <P> Flask is a Python framework that makes it easy to set up a local web server on your computer. 
    Using the provided code, it serves an index.html file, turning your machine into a temporary 
    web host. The app.run command starts this server, allowing you to access your webpage through a 
    local <mark style="color: brown ;font-size: x-large;">IP address like 127.0.0.1:5031</mark> in a browser. <br>
     The 0.0.0.0 host setting allows others on the
    same network to view it, useful for sharing without needing to upload the files. 
    This process simulates a basic live website, helping you test your front-end code locally 
    before deployment.</P>
