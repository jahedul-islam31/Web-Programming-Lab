                         <p>One thing that makes Barcelona FC truly unique is its status as a <mark style="color: brown;background-color: blue;">'Football Club.'</mark> It is one of the few remaining teams that is not a limited company. This means that the club is still owned by its members - there are <strong><i>144 thousand</i> </strong>of them. These members also choose the President of the team through a complex voting system.

            Barcelona FC's objectives are reflected strongly in their refusal to accept a corporate strip sponsor. <strong>On 07 September 2006,</strong> the team announced their new alliance with <u> <h3> UNICEF children's charity.</h3></u><hr> They pledged a yearly sum in donations to the <mark>HIV/AIDS</mark> department of the charity. They also used the space across their chests normally saved for major corporations to advertise UNICEF and thus, its cause. The team continue to wear the UNICEF logo on their strips.

            It is clear that Barcelona FC are well within their rights to claim that the institution that they have created is <u><mark  style="background-color: blanchedalmond;font-style: oblique;color: #000; ">"more than a club".</mark></u>
